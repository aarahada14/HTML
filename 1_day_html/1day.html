<u><b>orem Ipsum<b/></u> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text<small> ever since the 1500s,</small><big> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</big><hr> It has survived not only five centuries</hr>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
